## 🧩 Overview

Challenge developers to design and implement an **AI-powered vehicle condition assessment** feature.
The system should enable customers to capture photos at **pick-up and return**, automatically detect damages, and display reports.

**Accepted formats:** web app 🌐, mobile app 📱, or chatbot 🤖.
Use of pretrained AI/ML models or APIs is **allowed** ✅.

### 🧱 Tech Choice Clarification

* Choose **one frontend**: either **Web** 🌐 *or* **Mobile** 📱.
* You may use **any backend language or framework** (Node.js, Python, Go, etc.).
* No persistent storage is required — you can simulate uploads and results in memory.

**Goal:**

* Capture/upload vehicle images
* Detect & compare damages between pick-up and return
* Estimate severity & cost 💰
* Display results in a simple dashboard
* Provide REST or GraphQL APIs for integration

### 📱 Mobile App

Participants can build mobile apps using **React Native (Expo)**, **Flutter**, or **Native Android**.

#### **Option 1 — React Native (Expo)** 🥇

> ⚡ Recommended for solo developers — no native setup required.

**How to deploy:**

```bash
npx create-expo-app ai-vehicle-inspection
npx expo publish
```

**Shareable link example:**

```
https://expo.dev/@yourusername/ai-vehicle-inspection
```

Judges can open via **Expo Go** on iOS/Android instantly.
Include this link in your submission.

#### **Option 2 — Flutter**

> Build and share a lightweight web or APK build.

```bash
flutter build apk --debug
flutter build web
```

Then host:

* APK on Google Drive / GitHub Releases
* Web build on Vercel, Netlify, or Firebase Hosting

Include both the **download link** and **install instructions**.

#### **Option 3 — Native Android**

> For Kotlin/Java developers.

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

Upload `app-debug.apk` and share a public download link.

## 💬 FAQ & Tips

**Q:** Can we use stock/synthetic images?
**A:** ✅ Yes, label them clearly.

**Q:** Is custom training required?
**A:** ❌ No — use pretrained or hosted models.

**Q:** Do we need to set up storage?
**A:** ❌ No persistent storage required; simulate uploads and responses in memory.

**Q:** How do we estimate cost?
**A:** 💰 Use a simple rule-based or LLM-mapped function.

**Tip:** Spend your first 6–8 hours setting up architecture and AI integration, then focus on MVP delivery.

---

## 🧮 Example Cost Function

```js
const COST_BY_SEVERITY = {
  minor: 50,
  moderate: 150,
  severe: 450
};

function estimateCost(detections) {
  return detections.reduce(
    (sum, d) => sum + COST_BY_SEVERITY[d.severity || 'moderate'],
    0
  );
}
```
